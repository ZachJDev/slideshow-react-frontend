# React Open Access Slideshow

A React-based version of the [Open Access Slideshow](https://github.com/ZachJDev/open-access-slideshow-webpage).

Click on the shown picture to play or pause the slideshow. Searches (for now) will return at most 10 images.

## Known Issues

- [ ] Both the previous image and the current image are visible after searching
- [ ] Initial searches take a long time to complete (This is likely related to the heroku tier I'm using)
- [ ] the design is still a work in progress.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
